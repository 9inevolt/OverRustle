Tools to make destiny.gg suck less

# Destinychat.php

##Currently supports
 
* Twitch (live)
* Twitch HTML5 HLS Streams (only works on mobile)
* Twitch VOD's
* Justin.TV (live)
* Youtube live / Videos
* MLG.TV Streams** (In beta)
* Dailymotion


## How to use the VOD player

1. Get the link to the VOD (ex http://www.twitch.tv/kaceytron/b/526235388)
2. Switch player to Twitch-VOD and take the numbers after /b/ (ex 526235388) and copy them into Stream/ID box
3. Press enter and enjoy watching!

## Secrets within

* You can set Youtube and twitch-VOD time by adding &s=time in seconds to the URL.

## Help MLG does not work

* **Because apparently I am killing e-sports, MLG disabled embedding their stream. Except they still allow TeamLiquid embed, so I embed that embed. To get this to work you need to know the TL embed name. Use the name in-between /embed/ and /popout.
