# Destinychat.php

##Currently supports

## How to use the VOD / Youtube player

1. Get the link to the VOD / Video (ex http://www.twitch.tv/kaceytron/b/526235388 / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMgkt9jdjTU)
2. Switch player to Twitch-VOD or Youtube and take the numbers after /b/ (ex 526235388) or /watch (tMgkt9jdjTU) and copy them into Stream/ID box
3. Press enter and enjoy watching!

## Secrets within

* You can set Youtube and twitch-VOD time by adding &s=time in seconds to the URL.

## Help MLG does not work

* **Because apparently I am killing e-sports, MLG disabled embedding their stream. Except they still allow TeamLiquid embed, so I embed that embed. To get this to work you need to know the TL embed name. Use the name in-between /embed/ and /popout.

## Ustream

* *** Ustream embeds work, but you cannot get to them by name. This is how Ustream runs their platform. Grab the embed number here http://i.imgur.com/PsPpK7v.png and use that for Stream/ID

## What about Azubu?

* Since Azubu does not run its own streaming servers embedding is 100x more tricky, as they use brightcove and the embed process is more than 1 variable. http://pastebin.com/f8vBNJvp
